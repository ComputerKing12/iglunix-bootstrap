# Iglunix Bootstrap Scripts
Theses scripts bootstrap Iglunix from a GNU/Linux host.

```sh
git clone --depth=1 "https://github.com/iglunix/iglunix-bootstrap"
./boot.sh

# use sudo or doas to chroot into the new system
doas ./chroot.sh
```

## Notes
These scripts are currently WIP and have only been tested on Arch Linux.
